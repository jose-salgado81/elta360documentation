### Change the name of the project

To change the name of an existing project...

1. Log into your account and navigate to the **Projects** section
2. Select the **â‹®** icon of the project you want to edit, a menu will open.
3. Select **Edit Information** to open the Edit Project window.

![change%20project%20name](change%20project%20name.gif "change%20project%20name")

! The following is the same gif image parsed through a gif compressor reducing 58% file size, (from 3.4 MB to 1.4 MB) can you see a change in quality?

![change%20project%20name-min](change%20project%20name-min.gif "change%20project%20name-min")

! The following is the same sequence but encoded as an MP4 file with a 60% compression at 30 fps (544 Kbps file size). In some cases, a video is more convenient than an animated gif. For your convenience, I will provide you with both gifs and mp4 files.

![change%20project%20name](change%20project%20name.mp4 "change%20project%20name")
